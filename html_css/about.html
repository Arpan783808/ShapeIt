                <h1 class="abs-title" >OUR VISION</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center;"> Our goal is to provide a thorough and easily accessible resource for anyone seeking help or information regarding mental health concerns. Our website will offer accurate and current information regarding various mental health issues, including causes, symptoms, and available treatments.
                    Additionally, we will provide a self-assessment bot enabling users to evaluate their mental health and decide whether getting professional assistance would benefit them. The bot will offer tailored recommendations based on the user's answers, including details about nearby resources and how to get to them.
                    Besides the self-evaluation tool, our website will provide support groups for individuals seeking a secure and encouraging environment to interact with like-minded people. These groups, facilitated by qualified professionals, will give people a forum to talk about their experiences, support one another, and get advice from mental health specialists.
                    Our goal is to develop a website on which anyone looking for support and information on mental health issues can rely. Our mission is to provide individuals with the tools and resources they need to live their best lives, including the ability to take control of their mental health.</p>
